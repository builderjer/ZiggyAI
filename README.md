Personal Home Automation Software Colaboration and Mycroft.AI interigation

## Concept
The idea is to develop a smarthome with the lowest possible investment.
I will be using several Raspberry pi's and Arduinos to do the light lifting,
and an always on server to do the heavy part...I think.

Idealy, I would love to make my home self sufficent also, with solar and wind power
charging a battery bank and LED lighting for energy efficient.

Any ideas or comments are welcome!!
